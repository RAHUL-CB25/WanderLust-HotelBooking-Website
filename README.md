 Wanderlust - My Journey, My Story
Not all those who wander are lost."

Welcome to my travel diary project – a digital expression of my **deep passion for exploring the world**, new cultures, scenic places, and hidden gems. This isn't just a website; it's a reflection of 
**my wanderlust**, my dreams, and the footprints I've left (and plan to leave) across the globe.

✨ About
This project is a personal travel log and platform where I share:
- 📸 Stunning photos from my journeys
- 📝 Stories and experiences that touched my heart
- 📍 Travel tips and must-visit places
- 🌐 My bucket list destinations

Every part of this site was designed with love, and coded with care, to represent my vision of adventure and connection.
